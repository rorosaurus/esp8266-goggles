# Buttons and Modes
* Short click: changes the pattern (unless you're in a group)
* Medium hold: perform a wink, then resync with group
* Long hold: enable/disable wifi (green = enabled, red = disabled)

# General Tips
* Always double-check the polarity of the battery before inserting, or you'll fry it!
* When the LEDs stop animating and freeze, turn it off and recharge the battery!
  * This means the battery voltage is too low to run the microcontroller.  If it gets lower, that's fine - it will automatically cut off - but it's better (for the battery longevity) to not discharge so low.
* When charging, please keep it in the shade and make sure it isn't stuffed in a backpack or closed space.
  * Certain components on the PCB get **hot** during charging, so be careful!
* Charging maxes out at 1A, which would take ~3.4 hours to charge from worst case empty.
  * You need a micro USB cable to charge it.
  * If you unplug the charger when it's 90% done, it won't let you resume charging until it discharges more.  Try to leave it plugged in and charging (red LED indicator) until it's entirely done (green LED indicator).
  * Try not to leave it plugged in for excessive (many hours) lengths of time if it's done charging.
  * You can run it and charge it at the same time (USB battery pack)
    * Just be careful since the charging circuit on the PCB might get hot!
* Please don't just leave it sitting in direct sun.  The battery and electronics will thank you :)
